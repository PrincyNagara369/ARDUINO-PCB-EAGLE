# ARDUINO-PCB-EAGLE
The goal of the project was to create a custom Arduino board tailored to specific requirements.

I started by creating a schematic using Eagle's schematic editor. I carefully selected and placed components such as the microcontroller, capacitors, resistors, and other necessary peripherals. I made sure to establish proper connections between the components, considering factors like signal integrity and power distribution.

After completing the schematic, I switched to the PCB layout view in Eagle. I defined the board outline and positioned the components, ensuring an efficient and compact design. I paid attention to routing the connections, avoiding unnecessary overlaps or crossings. Additionally, I incorporated copper pours for power and ground planes to improve signal integrity and reduce noise.

Throughout the design process, I followed industry-standard design guidelines and performed a thorough Design Rule Check (DRC) to identify and rectify any errors or violations. I also generated the necessary Gerber files required for manufacturing, adhering to the specifications provided by the manufacturer.

Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my proficiency in Eagle software, PCB design principles, and attention to detail. It was a valuable learning experience, and I am proud of the final design outcome.
